## Adding Wallpapers
Guidelines for Wallpaper Submission

 -  **Resolution**: Wallpapers should be high-resolution, ideally at least `1920x1080` or higher.
 -  **Quality**: Ensure wallpapers are clear and visually appealing. Avoid pixelation and blurry images (make sure to test them).
 -  **File Format**: Use **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, **.png** or **.gif** formats only.
 -  **Category Folders**: Place each wallpaper in the category folder that best fits its style. `(e.g., Sci-fi, Dracula)`.

3. Place the **wallpaper** in the correct category folder.
4. **Run the Renaming Script**: After adding your wallpapers, run the renaming script to ensure consistent naming:
